#### Meet-Up Write-Up

1. I went to the Portland Tech Crawl on September 6th.
1. It was coordinated by The Dryt, but other companies like Moovel, Pollinate, Mozilla, etc. participated in the event.
1. It was a massive meet and greet and various tech companies around Portland.
1. The format of the event was a Meet and Greet/Networking, and a few companies had the opportunity to showcase some of their products.
1. I wanted to attend this event because I thought it would be a great way to meet some contacts in tech companies around Portland and see how they operate as well.
1. One of the highlights of the event was getting to meet Epicodus grads at almost every single company we went to, it was awesome to hear their story and get their advice as well.
1. I learned a lot about Portland tech companies, what kind of candidates they are looking for, but most of all it opened my eyes to all the different tech companies that I didn't know existed.
1. My only feedback for the event is that I wish it was longer, there were many companies on the list that I didn't get to visit because the time ran out.
1. I would definitely recommend this to my peers, it was a great opportunity to learn about the tech community here in Portland and get your face out there as well.
1. It was a great time and the free food and drinks were even better!
